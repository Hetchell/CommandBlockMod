This folder contain the resources that must go with the source code. 
The source code can just throw into a folder inside your namespace. May need to do refactoring. 
The resources: dump into folder that is read by a intepreter that combine the .pak file to the Content.pak of SC2. 
If you use my survivalcraft2 code, dump resources into '.../bin/mods' folder. 

**WARNING** if you don't attach resources, the code may return nullptrs.
